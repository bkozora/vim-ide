How to Install VIM-IDE in simple steps

Install VIM and Dependencies

Most Importantly, CTags
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install exhuberant-ctags

Or on new systems install Vim too
sudo apt-get install vim-runtime vim-common vim-gui-common vim-tiny curl exuberant-ctags

Clone the GIT repo to your HOME directory and go there
cd ~/
git clone https://lsfinteractive.unfuddle.com/git/lsfinteractive_vim-ide/ vim-ide
    OR
git clone https://github.com/bkozora/vim-ide

I've created a shell script to ease setup of new environments. So once it's cloned,
simply cd into the new directory and execute

cd vim-ide
./install.sh

That should handle it all for you, if not, here are the manual steps:

Get latest GIT Submodule dependencies
git submodule init
git submodule update

Create Symbolic Link to vim-ide so vim can find it
ln -s ~/vim-ide ~/.vim
ln -s ~/vim-ide/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
touch ~/.vimrc.local

The .vimrc.local file allows you to override configurations within my environment
that you absolutely hate. For some strange reason you despise line numbers? Simply
define:

set nonumber

in your ~/.vimrc.local file.

Check out the mappings files for details on mapped shortcuts. You can also run
:map from inside of vim to find more custom keymaps I've exposed. All default Vim
functionality should be left intact.

There are many color schemes included in the bundle. I've included a plugin to
make scrolling through them all easy. Simply press escape then type :SCROLL then
use the arrow keys to cycle through all of the themes. Once you find one you like
you can add it to your ~/.vimrc.local file like so:

colorscheme NameOfScheme

Enjoy!
